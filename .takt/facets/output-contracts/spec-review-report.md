# Spec Review Result

## Result: APPROVE / REJECT

Judgment criteria:

- APPROVE: No issues, or only minor improvement suggestions (no impediment to implementation)
- REJECT: Contradictions in requirements, critical omissions in files to change, etc. — proceeding to implementation would certainly cause rework

Minor improvement suggestions (naming alternatives, additional test case ideas, etc.) are filed as issues under APPROVE.
Ambiguity that implementers can reasonably resolve on their own is not grounds for REJECT.
